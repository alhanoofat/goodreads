Goodreads is the worldâ€™s largest site for readers and book recommendations. Using it, you can track the books you are reading, have read, and want to read.<br>
It also has a recommendation system that analyzes 20 billion data points to give suggestions tailored to your literary tastes.<br>
In this project, I performed web scraping to gather data about the best books of the 21st century, which are the best books published from January 1st, 2001 until today, rated by Goodreads users. The scraping process was handled usig BeautifulSoup.<br>
The dataframe contains features about 1500 books
